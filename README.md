Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is designing, developing and maintenance of a sytem software. Its important as it ensures high quality output that meet the users needs while minimising errors 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The birth of software engineering- This milestone formalised software development as an engineering discipline and introduced structured methodologies to reduce risks and improve quality
The advent of Object Oriented Programming- This milestone revolutionalised software development by introducing modularity and reusabilty
The rise of agile methodologies- This milestone emphasized in iterative development, customer collaboration and adaptability

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning- Defining the scope of the project, objectives, resources and timelines.Sets the foundation of the project.
2.Requirement analyis- Stakeholders gather and document functional and non functional requirement to ensure clarity
3.Design- Outlining the system architechture i.e uer interface, databaes and system components. Prototypes and mockups are also created.
4.Development(Coding)- Developer writethe code baed on design specifications
5.Testing- The software undergoes rigorous tests to identify and fix bugs
6.Deployment- The software is released to a production environment where end users can access it.
7.Maintenance- The software is monitored for issues and updated with new features for long term functionality

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is approached in a linear and sequantial manner and requires heavy documentation while agile methodology is approached in an iterative and incremental manner and requires minimal documentation.
Waterfall methodology can be used in government software and construction project while agile methodology can be used in marketin campaign and mobile app development

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- Design, develops, tests and maintans software
Quality Assuarance Engineer- Ensures the softwaremeets the quality standards through testing and validation
Project Manager- Overees the project life cycle ensuring timely delivery within budget and scope

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Importance of IDE- Provide a unified platform for coding, debugging and developing software e.g Visual Studio and intelliJ IDEA
Importance of VCS- Manage changes to source code enabling collaboration among developers e.g Git and Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapid Technological Advancements- Dedicate time for continous learning through courses and tech blogs
Changing requirements- Adopt agile methodologies for iterative progress and modular designs to handle evolving needs
Time Constraints- Use time management techniques and prioritize tasks
Collaboration issues- Foster open communication and use collaboration tools

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing- Tests individual components and funtions of the code to ensure they work as expected. It is important as it ensures bugs are identified early in the development process
Intergration Testing- Verifies that different module interact correctly. it important as it detects interface defects and ensures data flows properly
System Testing- Ensure the entire system meets functional and non functional reqirements. It ensures software behaves as expected
Acceptance Testing- Vaalidates whether the software meets user requirement and is ready for deployment. It ensures the product aligns with business goals and user expectation

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is designing and refining input prompts to guide generative AI models to produce accurate, relevant and meaningful outputs

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
